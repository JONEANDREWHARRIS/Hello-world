**Format:** 1920x1080, 30fps, motion graphics with kinetic typography
**Source:** Reddit r/SideProject — "I tested nearly all the vibe coding app builders"
**Author context:** iOS engineer, 8 years experience, tested every major tool
**Goal:** Rank the top 5 tools for beginners who want to ship their first real mobile app

## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (read aloud — ~60 seconds)

> An iOS engineer with 8 years of experience tested nearly every vibe coding app builder out there. His goal? Find the best tools for shipping real mobile apps — not just websites. Here's his ranking.
>
> Number one: Vibecode. The mobile-first winner. It builds real native iOS and Android apps. Describe your app, test it on your phone, and push it straight to the App Store. It handles UI, logic, and APIs — not just front-end. The author said: if a non-technical friend asked me how to ship a mobile app, I'd send them Vibecode first.
>
> Number two: Rork. Own your code. It runs React Native and Expo under the hood, with fast previews that don't break. The big advantage — full code ownership. You can export to GitHub anytime. Pro tip from the author: prototype in Rork, sync to GitHub, then refine with Cursor.
>
> Number three: Replit. The cloud playground. It's a full development environment in your browser — editor, terminal, database, hosting, all in one. Great for learning and quick prototypes. But the author's honest take: fun for experiments, but for mobile shipping, he prefers Vibecode or Rork.
>
> Number four: Cursor. The pro's workbench. A VS Code-style IDE with AI built right in. It supports Claude, GPT, and other models. Perfect for repo-wide refactors and adding features. Not a one-click builder though — the author uses it to polish code exported from Vibecode or Rork.
>
> Number five: Rocket. One to watch. Import a Figma design and turn it into a full app. It aims at building real apps, not toy demos. But the author says: he watches it, but wouldn't move his production app there yet. Still early stage.
>
> There you have it — five tools, ranked by someone who actually ships apps for a living. Start with number one and level up from there. Ship your first app this week.

## VOICEOVER NOTES

- Total script is ~340 words, reads in about 55-60 seconds at a natural pace
- Leave ~0.5s of silence at the very start and end
- Emphasize tool names and rank numbers
- The quote lines should feel like natural paraphrasing, not robotic reading
- Recommended: record in a quiet space, or use ElevenLabs / PlayHT for AI voice
- Audio file should be placed at `public/voiceover.mp3` and imported with Remotion's `<Audio>` component
