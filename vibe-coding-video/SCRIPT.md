- Handles UI, logic, and APIs — not just front-end
- Author's exact words: "If a non-technical friend asked me how to ship a mobile app without hiring a dev, I would send Vibecode first."

**VOICEOVER (if adding narration):**
> "Number one: Vibecode. Truly mobile-first. Describe your app, test it on your phone, ship it to the App Store. The author said if a friend wanted to ship an app, he'd send them here first."

- Harder for people with zero coding background

**VOICEOVER (if adding narration):**
> "Number four: Cursor. A VS Code IDE with AI built in. Not a one-click builder, but the author's go-to for polishing code exported from other tools."
