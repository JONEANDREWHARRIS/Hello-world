# Venture Capital (VC) — Knowledge Base

## What is Venture Capital?

Venture Capital (VC) is a form of private equity financing that provides funding to **early-stage, high-growth startups** in exchange for equity. VC firms bet on innovative companies with the potential for outsized returns, knowing that most investments will fail but a few "home runs" will drive fund performance.

## Key Concepts

### Fund Structure
- **General Partner (GP):** The VC firm managing the fund and making investment decisions.
- **Limited Partner (LP):** Institutional investors, endowments, family offices, and individuals who provide capital.
- **Fund Lifecycle:** Typically 10–12 years with a ~3–5 year investment period.

### How VC Firms Make Money
| Fee / Return | Description |
|---|---|
| **Management Fee** | ~2% of committed capital per year |
| **Carried Interest** | ~20% of profits (sometimes 25–30% for top-tier firms) |

### Stages of VC Investment
| Stage | Typical Check Size | Company Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-Seed** | $50K–$500K | Idea / prototype stage |
| **Seed** | $500K–$3M | Early product, initial traction |
| **Series A** | $5M–$15M | Product-market fit, scaling |
| **Series B** | $15M–$50M | Rapid growth, expanding team/market |
| **Series C+** | $50M–$200M+ | Scaling globally, path to IPO/exit |
| **Growth / Late Stage** | $100M+ | Pre-IPO, proven business model |

### Key VC Terms
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Valuation (Pre/Post-Money)** | Company value before/after investment. Post = Pre + Investment. |
| **Dilution** | Reduction in ownership % when new shares are issued |
| **Term Sheet** | Non-binding agreement outlining deal terms |
| **Cap Table** | Spreadsheet tracking ownership stakes of all shareholders |
| **Liquidation Preference** | Investors get paid back first (1x, 2x) before common shareholders |
| **Anti-Dilution** | Protects investors if future rounds are at a lower valuation (down round) |
| **Pro-Rata Rights** | Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership % |
| **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) | Convertible instrument common in seed rounds (created by Y Combinator) |
| **Convertible Note** | Debt that converts to equity at a future priced round |

### The Power Law in VC
VC returns follow a **power law distribution**:
- ~65% of investments return less than 1x (losses)
- ~25% return 1–5x (modest wins)
- ~10% return 10x+ (home runs that drive fund returns)

A single investment returning 50–100x+ can return the entire fund. This is why VCs seek companies with potential for **massive scale**.

### Key Metrics
| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **IRR** | Annualized return accounting for timing of cash flows |
| **TVPI** | Total value (realized + unrealized) vs. paid-in capital |
| **DPI** | Cash returned to LPs vs. capital contributed |
| **Gross / Net Returns** | Returns before/after fees and carry |
| **Burn Rate** | How fast a startup spends cash (monthly) |
| **Runway** | Months of cash remaining at current burn rate |
| **MRR / ARR** | Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue (for SaaS companies) |
| **CAC / LTV** | Customer Acquisition Cost / Lifetime Value |

### VC Investment Process
1. **Sourcing** — Finding startups (inbound, referrals, events, cold outreach)
2. **Screening** — Initial evaluation of team, market, product, traction
3. **Deep Dive** — Product demos, customer references, market analysis
4. **Partnership Meeting** — Internal discussion and decision
5. **Term Sheet** — Presenting investment terms to the founder
6. **Due Diligence** — Legal, financial, technical, and background checks
7. **Closing** — Signing legal documents and wiring funds
8. **Post-Investment** — Board seats, mentorship, follow-on support

### Exit Strategies
- **IPO** (Initial Public Offering) — Going public on a stock exchange
- **M&A** (Merger & Acquisition) — Sold to a larger company
- **Secondary Sale** — Selling shares to another investor
- **SPAC** — Merging with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company

| **Leverage (Debt)** | Heavy use of debt | Little to no debt |
| **Risk Profile** | Lower risk, steady returns | High risk, power-law returns |
| **Value Creation** | Operational improvement | Scaling innovation |
| **Typical Hold** | 3–7 years | 5–10 years |
