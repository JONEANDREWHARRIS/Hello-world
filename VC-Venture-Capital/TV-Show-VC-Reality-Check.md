# VC Reality Check — TV Show vs. Real Venture Capital

## Original Transcript

> *From a VC partner (Forbes-listed) breaking down how realistic a TV show's portrayal of venture capital is.*

If you've been watching this season, you've probably noticed that Jeremiah, Stephen, and Denise are working at Jeremiah's dad's venture capital firm. So I thought I'd break down a few of the scenes and share how realistic they are from the perspective of someone who's actually in venture. My super quick background is that I'm a partner at an early stage venture fund by day and I was on the Forbes list for VC last year.

So immediately one of the first things I clocked was that Stephen, Denise, and Jeremiah are all essentially working in venture straight out of undergrad. That's not totally impossible, but it is pretty rare. Most associates come into firms with two to three years of prior experience, typically in banking, consulting, or previously having worked at a startup. But also worth remembering that there isn't a playbook path into venture and that a lot of times people come in with very mixed backgrounds. The main reason most venture funds don't take people immediately out of college is really because you kind of have to have a good sense of how businesses operate. And without any prior exposure, it's kind of hard to add value in a meaningful way.

The other thing I noticed was the suits and attire. I noticed that Jeremiah and Stephen were almost always in suits. I would say that probably is more aligned to private equity or growth equity where the culture is a bit closer to banking. But early stage VC firms are much more adjacent to startups. So people will wear jeans, casual stuff, probably not hoodies and sweatpants like some startups. But I'd also say you don't really see banker level formal work.

There's also this one scene where Jeremiah's dad is staring at stock tickers. And it's generally true that VCs care and need to know about the broader market sentiment. But venture capital is not like hedge funds or trading. You're typically not glued to the screen tracking daily stock movements because you're really investing over very long tenure time horizons.

Also in the first episode, there's a scene where Stephen and Denise are called into the office on a Sunday. And while it's true that you'll maybe work weekends, especially if there's a deal that's closing, I would say it's pretty uncommon for people to physically show up to the office on a Sunday. Venture isn't really like banking where it's known for, you know, these very long nights and weekends. And the hours in venture are actually relatively reasonable. So yeah, Sunday office days aren't really a thing.

And then I also wanted to talk about that hot deal, Starcade X, where Denise talks about every firm trying to get in on that deal. That one, I actually think is pretty realistic because when you have a hot company that's raising, they can't take every single investor's money. And so founders are pretty deliberate about which funds they bring onto their cap table because they have limited space. And so when Denise mentions that all these investors are competing, it basically means that they're doing due diligence on the company, but also their VC firm is trying to convince the founder that they should be the chosen partner. And there are a bunch of different ways that VC firms compete. It might mean offering the founders a higher valuation or other times I've literally seen it meaning people showing up in person where partners on the deal team fly across the country just to have dinner with a founder and secure a term sheet.

Those are just a few of my takes. And there were a lot more things I observed. So let me know if you want a part two.

## Analysis — Key Takeaways

The speaker is a Forbes-listed VC partner evaluating a TV show's portrayal of venture capital. Here are the **5 scenes** they assessed and whether they're realistic:

| # | TV Show Scene | Realistic? | Reality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Characters work in VC straight out of college | Mostly No | Most VC associates have 2–3 years of experience in banking, consulting, or startups first. No fixed path in, but fresh grads are rare. |
| 2 | Characters always wear suits | No | Suits = PE/banking culture. VC is casual — jeans and smart-casual, closer to startup culture. Not hoodies, but not suits either. |
| 3 | Jeremiah's dad stares at stock tickers | Mostly No | VCs track broad market sentiment but don't watch daily stock prices. VC is long-term investing (5–10 years), not day trading. |
| 4 | Called into the office on a Sunday | No | VC has reasonable hours. Weekend work happens during deal closings, but physically going to the office on a Sunday is very uncommon. Not like banking. |
| 5 | "Starcade X" — every firm competing for a hot deal | Yes | Hot startups get flooded with investor interest. Founders choose who gets on the cap table. VCs compete by offering higher valuations, flying out for dinners, and hustling to win the deal. |

### Underlying VC Principles Highlighted

1. **VC is relationship-driven, not transactional.** Winning deals means building trust with founders, not just writing checks.
2. **VC culture is casual and startup-adjacent.** It's not Wall Street — the dress code and work-life balance reflect that.
3. **VC is a long game.** Investments play out over 5–10+ years. Daily market swings matter less than long-term company trajectory.
4. **Experience matters in VC.** Understanding how businesses operate is critical to evaluating startups and adding value to founders.
5. **Hot deals create competition among investors.** When a startup is in demand, the power shifts to the founder, and VCs must pitch themselves.

## Explain It Like I'm 5 (ELI5)

Imagine you and your friends have a **lemonade stand contest**. A grown-up (that's the VC person) walks around looking at all the lemonade stands and picks which ones to give their pocket money to. They hope that one of those lemonade stands becomes SUPER popular and makes lots and lots of money someday.

Now, a TV show tried to show what these grown-ups do at work. A real VC person watched the show and said:

### "Can kids run a VC firm?"
The show has young people working at the firm right after school. The real VC says: **"Hmm, not really."** Usually you need to learn about how businesses work first — like learning to ride a bike with training wheels before going on the big bike. Most people work at other jobs for a few years before they can help pick which lemonade stands are good ones.

### "Do they wear fancy suits?"
The show characters wear suits every day. The real VC says: **"Nope!"** Real VC people dress more like your cool older cousin — jeans and nice shirts. They're not as fancy as bankers but not as casual as someone working from their couch in pajamas.

### "Do they watch numbers on a screen all day?"
The show has someone staring at numbers going up and down. The real VC says: **"Not really."** That's more like a stock trader. VC people are like planting a tree — you don't stare at it every second waiting for it to grow. You plant it, take care of it, and check on it sometimes, but you know it takes a LONG time to grow big.

### "Do they work on Sundays?"
The show makes them come to the office on a Sunday. The real VC says: **"Almost never!"** VC isn't like some jobs where you work ALL the time. It's actually pretty normal hours. Maybe sometimes when something really exciting is happening, but not just a regular Sunday.

### "Do lots of people fight to give money to one lemonade stand?"
The show has all the VCs trying to invest in one hot company. The real VC says: **"YES! This one is real!"** Imagine if ONE lemonade stand made the most amazing lemonade ever. Every grown-up with pocket money would say "Pick me! Pick me! Let ME give you money!" The lemonade stand kid gets to choose who they want. Sometimes the grown-ups even fly on airplanes just to have dinner with the lemonade kid and say "Please pick me!" That part is totally real.

### The Big Lesson (for a 5-year-old)
VC people are like talent scouts looking for the BEST lemonade stands (startups). They give them money to grow bigger, and if the lemonade stand becomes a HUGE company someday, everybody makes a lot of money. But you have to be patient, be nice, and really understand what makes a good lemonade stand — and you don't need to wear a suit to do it!
