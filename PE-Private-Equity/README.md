# Private Equity (PE) — Knowledge Base

## What is Private Equity?

Private Equity (PE) refers to investment funds that acquire equity ownership in companies that are **not publicly traded** on a stock exchange. PE firms raise capital from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals (Limited Partners) and deploy it to buy, improve, and eventually sell companies for a profit.

## Key Concepts

### Fund Structure
- **General Partner (GP):** The PE firm that manages the fund, sources deals, and makes investment decisions.
- **Limited Partner (LP):** Investors who commit capital to the fund (pension funds, endowments, family offices, sovereign wealth funds).
- **Fund Lifecycle:** Typically 10 years — ~5 years investing, ~5 years harvesting/exiting.

### How PE Firms Make Money
| Fee / Return | Description |
|---|---|
| **Management Fee** | ~2% of committed capital per year |
| **Carried Interest** | ~20% of profits above a hurdle rate (usually 8%) |
| **Deal Fees** | Transaction, monitoring, and advisory fees |

### Common PE Strategies
1. **Leveraged Buyout (LBO)** — Acquiring a company using significant debt financing.
2. **Growth Equity** — Minority or majority investment in growing companies.
3. **Distressed / Turnaround** — Investing in struggling companies to restructure them.
4. **Secondaries** — Buying existing PE fund stakes from other LPs.
5. **Fund of Funds** — Investing in multiple PE funds for diversification.

### The LBO Model (Core PE Skill)
An LBO model projects:
- **Entry valuation** (purchase price, debt/equity mix)
- **Operating improvements** (revenue growth, margin expansion)
- **Debt paydown** over the hold period
- **Exit valuation** and resulting **IRR / MOIC** (Multiple on Invested Capital)

### Key Metrics
| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **IRR** (Internal Rate of Return) | Annualized return accounting for timing of cash flows |
| **MOIC** (Multiple on Invested Capital) | Total value returned vs. equity invested (e.g., 2.5x) |
| **DPI** (Distributions to Paid-In) | Cash actually returned to LPs vs. capital contributed |
| **TVPI** (Total Value to Paid-In) | Realized + unrealized value vs. capital contributed |

### Value Creation Levers
- **Revenue growth** (organic or add-on acquisitions)
- **Margin improvement** (cost cutting, operational efficiency)
- **Multiple expansion** (selling at a higher EV/EBITDA than entry)
- **Debt paydown** (using cash flow to reduce leverage, increasing equity value)

## PE Deal Lifecycle
1. **Sourcing** — Identifying target companies
2. **Due Diligence** — Financial, legal, commercial, and operational review
3. **Structuring** — Determining debt/equity mix, management incentives
4. **Execution** — Closing the transaction
5. **Value Creation** — Implementing operational improvements
6. **Exit** — Selling via IPO, secondary sale, or strategic buyer
